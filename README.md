1.	Python Anaconda Setup: 
Go to https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual
Click "Download" and it jumps to "Anaconda Installers". Choose the operating system in your computer Windows, macOS, or Linux. Select Python 3.8 version, 64-Bit Graphical Installer. Download Anaconda installation application. After download, double click to install Anaconda in your computer.

2.	Git Setup: 
Install Git from https://git-scm.com/downloads
3.	Set up a Github Account: 
    Go to www.github.com to set up your account if you don’t have a Github account yet. We will use Github to download popular machine learning study materials and projects, as well as turn in your projects in Github. 
4.	Install Sublime Text: 
    We will learn how to edit Markdown document in Sublime Text for your project writeup. 
5.	Computer and Internet: 
    Bring your computer every class and make sure internet is available.
6.	Book and Materials: 
    We will use “Python机器学习及实践：从零开始通往Kaggle竞赛之路” by 范淼 & 李超 as our class reference book. The python codes in this book will be used in class. The code can be downloaded from https://github.com/godfanmiao/DIY_ML_Systems_with_Python_1st_Edition. Try to use Git to download it instead of downloading directly from Github website. Under Git and the directory you want the downloaded folder to be located at, type 
    “git clone https://github.com/godfanmiao/DIY_ML_Systems_with_Python_1st_Edition”. You can buy this book from website if necessary.
    If we have the additional time to learn more machine learning and deep learning applications, then we will learn several machine learning applications undr "OpenVINO", developed by Intel. The second reference book is "深度学习图像识别技术：基于TensorFlow和OpenVINO工具" by 庄建, 张晶, and 许钰雯. The code downloaded direction can be found at https://github.com/dlod-openvino/book.
    I call these two books are reference books but not textbooks becasue I will use some parts of these two books but will not follow their structures in class. However, you will find many useful information for this class.  

See You All in Class!
